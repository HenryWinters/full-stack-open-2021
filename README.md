This course consisted of many hands-on exercises and projects that we were to complete on our own. Here are a few of the most notable ones I completed as part of this course: 

### Blog App

Full stack application built with React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. Users can log in and post blogs. Blog post will add to blog feed and include blog details and like button. Token based authentication to allow only the user who created the blog to delete it. Robust testing with jest and end to end testing with cypress.

### Countries App

Application to practice working with external REST APIs. App calls the RestCountries API to receive country data. Search bar will display list of countries. Clicking 'show' will show country details - name, capital, flag, etc. - and make a call to the OpenWeather api to give user the capital's current weather in real-time.
